## Samples:

All these samples use the Node.JS Maps Client Library. To use any of these samples.

``` bash
node geocode.js
```
The client libraries currently support:
* Directions API
* Distance Matrix API
* Elevation API
* Geocoding API
* Places SDK
* Roads API
* Time Zone API

Documentation for each service in the client is found [here](https://googlemaps.github.io/google-maps-services-js/docs/GoogleMapsClient.html).

Both coordinates or regular addresses are fine.
Follow sample distance.js for instructions how to use coordinates.
