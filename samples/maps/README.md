### How to test maps:

Assuming you have nvm and node installed.
Go to the directory you want to try out and type:

``` bash
node app.js
```
The server will start right up, if you want to see the map, visit: localhost:8080 in your browser.

When you want to exit the server, press control + c in your computer.
